This is just a simple 2D videogame to test my capabilities of developing a complex project.
The game is as simple as it can be, you have to look for the key to open the door, and grab the chest.
All the images have been developed by me, but they are freely usable for any type of content.
Just that, hope to develop more interesting projects such as this videogame :)
